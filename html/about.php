                    <p class="font-paragraph-lead">The Grain Ingredient company in the grain processing and baking sector is the official distributor in Russia, the EurAsEC countries, the Baltic States and Asia of the world leader in the field of biotechnology-the DSM company, which has the most diverse and rich portfolio of enzyme preparations, vitamins, nutraceuticals and other special products, as well as the largest market share worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="font-paragraph-lead">Historically, the ingredient industry in Russia is rather poorly developed. Most of the food ingredients and functional complex food additives are of imported origin. Therefore, we believe that the successful implementation of our projects is very important for the food industry of the Russian Federation, as thanks to cooperation with us, many companies in Russia, the EurAsEC, the Baltic States and Asia are able to expand their business by developing new markets for complex food additives under their own brands and trademarks.</p>

                    <h2>Partnership</h2>
                    <p>The partnership between DSM and grain Ingredient began with a distribution relationship, and then developed into a unique project for the production of various enzyme compositions and adaptations under the EnzoWay brand.</p>
                    <p>The main goal of this project is to help our customers-manufacturers of food additives-in developing and creating a multi-faceted range of flour improvers for bakery, flour confectionery and pasta products, quick-frozen semi-finished products, as well as improvers for correcting the milling properties of grain. This was followed by the following partnership projects to create composite antioxidants under the "LongWay" brand and yeast extracts under the "SavorWay" brand.</p>

                    <h2>Grain Ingredient in Russia</h2>
                    <p>Historically, the ingredient industry in Russia is rather poorly developed. Most of the food ingredients and functional complex food additives are of imported origin. Therefore, we believe that the successful implementation of our projects is very important for the food industry of the Russian Federation, as thanks to cooperation with us, many companies in Russia, the EurAsEC, the Baltic States and Asia are able to expand their business by developing new markets for complex food additives under their own brands and trademarks.</p>
                    <p>Currently, the Russian food industry is assigned the priority task of reducing import dependence by increasing production capacity. The level of development of the sector will determine the possibility of Autonomous survival of the country in such critical macroeconomic conditions. Thus, the focus on systematic import substitution in the food industry will play a key role in addressing the issue of providing citizens with food products that meet standards and regulatory requirements in the range and volume sufficient to form a balanced diet. Thus, the international market situation has created incentive conditions for the development of own production in the segments of medium and small businesses. The revealed trends indicate the possibilities of the domestic food industry, which is one of the most important links of the industrial production complex of Russia. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, in the conditions of sanctions confrontation with Western countries in this sector of the economy, work should be intensified to improve the competitiveness of national products and develop new competitive types of products. The development of the baking industry and improvement of processes in the production of flour are urgent tasks today.</p>
